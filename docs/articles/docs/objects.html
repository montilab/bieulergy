<p>Network objects are essentially undirected igraph objects with pre-computed graph and node level properties. Additionally, they allow a mapping of unique node identifiers to human-readable symbols. These symbols are typically gene or protein symbols. This allows for integrating enrichment-based analysis or incorporating node-level information into network analyses.</p>
